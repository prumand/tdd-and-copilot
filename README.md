## Introduction
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that involves writing tests before writing code. The idea is to specify the expected behavior and functionality of the code, and then write the code that passes the tests. TDD can help developers write cleaner, more reliable, and more maintainable code.

Co-Pilot can suggest code snippets and generate tests based on natural language descriptions. Co-Pilot can work with any programming language and framework, and can integrate with popular code editors. It's conviend to use and acts as lens on you code repository.
With the context of the repository it can suggest the correct test requirements (e.g. function names, readme). Furthermore the technical setup (like mocking) is highly assisted. It seems co-pilot is a very good fit for testing.

With this repo, I try to show how I use TDD and Co-Pilot to write code.
