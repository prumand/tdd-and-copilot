# Bootstrap LLM

## Change Log


## Notes

1. First promt asking bing to find resources, how to bootstrap llms
```
Can you help me finding the resources to bootstrap opensource LLM models on mac airbook?
https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora seems to be a good resource.

Thanks for sharing the link. However, it seems that the link you shared is for a different project than what you were looking for. The link you shared is for a LoRaWAN library for Alpaca IoT devices.

If you are looking for resources to bootstrap open-source LLM models on your Mac Airbook, I found some resources that might be helpful:

Dolly 2.0: A free, open-source ChatGPT-style AI model.
MLC LLM: A universal solution that allows any language models to be deployed natively on a diverse set of hardware backends and native applications.
llama.cpp: A tool that can run Metaâ€™s new GPT-3-class AI large language model, LLaMA, locally on a Mac laptop.
I hope this helps!
```
2. second try phind.com. Couldn't craft a good promt. Haluzination. Idea is not to host the model for the first tries.
```
How can I set up a private LLM with firebase?
```
